## Live Markdown Editor
    Just a simple web app to write some markdown and get a live preview of how it looks.
    Save markdowns to the cloud in firebase

### why this app?
    Markdown is used all the time for my readme files in GitHub
    I made a blog app and have been writing posts I needed something like this.
    Currently whats out there doesnt fit my needs exactly

### `getting started`
    clone app
    npm install
    npm start
    - to use the save functionality you will need to create your own firebase project
    - try the full app HERE
